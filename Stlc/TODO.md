* LNgen generate close_freshen
* Company-coq and completion from other modules
* Better definition of get in metalib (plus theory about get?)

* faster default_simp? (or slower: add autorewrite with hint DB?)
* can replace apply_heap/apply_stack/fv_stack with fold?

* patch Ott for metalib namespace (more generally, allow embeds at beginning
  of file.)


* merge branches for LNgen into master (make old releases?)

* edit Ott to produce good nominal output
* patch Ott for fset based fv function

* Type classes ??? for LNgen
