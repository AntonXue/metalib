An interactive tutorial on specifying and implementing the simply-typed
lambda calculus in Coq.

CONTENTS

Read through the tutorial files in this order. The files that end in `full`
have embedded exercises, and the solutions are in the associated `sol` files.

     Lec1\_full.v      - First set of lecture notes, with exercises
                         about LN
     Definitions.v     - Specification of STLC using locally nameless
                         representation (LN)
     Lec2\_full.v      - LN continued: type soundness for STLC
     Lemmas.v          - Auxiliary lemmas about LN, generated by LNgen tool
     Nominal\_full.v   - Definition of STLC using nominal representation,
                         abstract machine based small-step semantics
     Connect\_full.v   - Proof that nominal abstract machine implements
                         LN substitution-based small-step semantics

Warning, the exercises start simple, but ramp up. The first two files have
significantly simpler exercises than the second two files.

This directory also include several files that were used to generate the
above, using the [Ott](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/)
and [LNgen](https://github.com/plclub/lngen) tools.

     stlc.ott          - Ott specification of STLC
     stlc.mng          - LaTeX source
     Stlc.v            - Ott-generated version of `Definitions.v`
     Stlc_inf.v        - LNgen generated version of `Lemmas.v`

	 coqsplit.ml       - Utility for separating exercises from solutions
     Lec1.v            - Sources for the tutorial
	 Lec2.v
	 Nominal.v
	 Connect.v

INSTALLATION

  This tutorial depends on the `Metalib.Metatheory` library, available in the same
  repository.

    `make coq`        - Compile all Coq files

    `make spec`       - Make small PDF spec document

  If you have Ott and LNgen installed, you may also generate the two .v files
  above.

    `make Stlc.v`     - Run Ott
    `make Stlc_inf.v` - Run LNgen
