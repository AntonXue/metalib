An interactive tutorial on specifying and implementing the simply-typed
lambda calculus in Coq.

CONTENTS

  Definitions.v     - Specification of STLC using locally nameless
                      representation (LN)
  Lec1\_full.v      - First set of lecture notes, with exercises
                      about LN
  Lec2\_full.v      - LN continued: type soundness for STLC
  Lemmas.v          - Auxiliary lemmas about LN, generated by LNgen tool
  Nominal.v         - Definition of STLC using nominal representation,
	                  abstract machine based small-step semantics
  Connect.v         - Proof that nominal abstract machine implements
                      LN substitution-based small-step semantics
